knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


You are currently in the GitHub repository (repo) for `HW-3`. You must have
completed all the steps in [Setting 
Up](https://rudeboybert.github.io/MATH216/jekyll/update/2016/09/12/getting-started.html).





## Learning Goals

* Using the insight you garned from your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in
HW-2, you will now fit a logistic regression model to predict users' sex.
* Understand what **out-of-sample** prediction is




## Homework

1. Follow the same workflow as in <a target="_blank" class="page-link"
href="https://github.com/2016-09-Middlebury-Data-Science/HW-0#homework">HW-0</a>
for HW-3.
1. Do not submit a `HW-3.Rmd` file that does not knit.
1. I anticipate you spending between 8-12 total (across all submissions) on this 
homework.





## Data

Result of a Python script that scraped the OkCupid website.  We consider 59K
users who were:

* members on 2012/06/26
* within 25 miles of SF
* online in the last year
* have at least one photo

Their public profiles were pulled on 2012/06/30.  i.e. only data thatâ€™s visible 
to the public. Also included are essay question response data in variables 
`essay0` through `essay9`. The codebook for the data is available 
[here](https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid/blob/master/okcupid_codebook.txt).
Note:

* Usernames were excluded from data set. However, this is **not** a guarantee of de-anonymization.
* Permission to use this data was granted from OkCupid.

Run the following code once to download the OkCupid data from GitHub into your 
`HW-2` RStudio project i.e. into your `HW-2` folder. After you run this, there 
should be a file `profiles.csv` in the same directory as all your `HW-2` files.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
url <- "https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid/blob/master/profiles.csv.zip?raw=true"
temp_zip_file <- tempfile()
download.file(url, temp_zip_file)
unzip(temp_zip_file, "profiles.csv")
```

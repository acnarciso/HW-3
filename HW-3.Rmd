# Do not edit this code block. By setting cache=TRUE, we are saving the output 
# of this block to the cache. That way it only needs to run once.  This is
# especially useful for portions of code that take a long time to run.

* The URL of the RPubs published URL [here](https://www.nhl.com/).
* What gave you the most trouble:
* Any comments you have:



## Question 1:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `profiles` data set,
specifically on the relationship between gender and

* `income`
* `job`
* One more categorical variable of your choice

all keeping in mind in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to
predict a user's gender based on these variables.
